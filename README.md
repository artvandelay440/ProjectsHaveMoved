Please visit my new GitHub username @ArtisanByteCrafter at

https://github.com/ArtisanByteCrafter

If you're here, you've probably found an old link. I have changed my github username from artvandelay440 to ArtisanByteCrafter.

I have created this account so nobody can claim it and setup redirects claiming to be me.

Thanks!
